### Data Model

We'll use AsyncStorage to store our decks and flashcards. Redux is optional for this project.

Using AsyncStorage you'll manage an object whose shape is similar to this:

{
  React: {
    title: 'React',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is React?',
        answer: 'A library for managing user interfaces'
      },
      {
        question: 'Where do you make Ajax requests in React?',
        answer: 'The componentDidMount lifecycle event'
      }
    ]
  },
  JavaScript: {
    title: 'JavaScript',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is a closure?',
        answer: 'The combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.'
      }
    ]
  }
}

### API

To manage your AsyncStorage database, you'll want to create four different helper methods.

`getDecks`: return all of the decks along with their titles, questions, and answers.
`getDeck`: take in a single id argument and return the deck associated with that id.
`saveDeckTitle`: take in a single title argument and add it to the decks.
`addCardToDeck`: take in two arguments, title and card, and will add the card to the list of questions for the deck with the associated title.
